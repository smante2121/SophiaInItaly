        <h2 id="mission_h">My Mission</h2>
<p class="indent">My mission is to help guide and advice and guide other on their future travel plans to Italy through sharing my personal experience traveling through the country. By providing information on my favorite destinations, attractions, and dinning, I hope to help others efficiently plan and schedule their next trip.</p> 
    <p class="indent">Italy is a beautiful country with so much to offer for everyone. Its colorful history goes back centuries.  Traces of its many people and periods can be found scattered about through monuments and ruins. The Mediterranean climate of Italy allows for luscious greenery, bountiful crops, and year-round exploration of the country’s mountains, coastlines, and lakes. </p>
   <p>With all that Italy has to offer, it is important to schedule and plan your trip ahead of time so you can visit all the great wonders of the country.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="images/me.jpeg" alt="photo of me">
<p class="indent">My name is Sophia Mantegari, and this is my travel guide. I have traveling to Italy numerous times and to most of the country’s major cities. Many of my trips are for visiting my father’s side of the family in Parma Italy. More recently I spent a summer abroad and had the freedom to go on my own personal adventures across Italy. My trips to and throughout Italy have been my favorite explorations and have created so many lifelong memories. I created this page to share those experiences and help others develop the same love I have for Italy.</p>
